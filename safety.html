        <p>Although our project did not use any particularly hazardous materials and both model organisms are
            classified in the lowest risk group, we took the safety of all our members as a high priority. Before
            being permitted to enter the lab, all members were required to pass a series of online safety training
            courses through Vanderbilt's VandySafe system. During a separate safety training meeting, members were
            informed of the proper way to dispose all used lab materials, procedures to take in the event of an
            emergency, proper handling of certain potentially hazardous chemicals, and general safe lab equipment
            use for items like Bunsen burners. We modeled our safety training after suggestions made by Vanderbilt
            Environmental Health and Safety (VEHS). </p>
        <p>One area of extra concern is that the transformed E. coli strains used have antibiotic resistance genes
            against both ampicillin and kanamycin. If these organisms were to escape the lab environment, it is
            conceivable that these resistance genes could undergo lateral gene transfer. The spread of antibiotic
            resistance in this way is significant to considerations of public health. Aside from the number of lab
            oratory precautions we had taken in terms of maintaining sterile technique and properly disposing of al
            l possible biohazards, in the design of our project we noted that homologous recombination into yeast
            would greatly reduce the danger of resistance genes spreading to other organisms.</p>
