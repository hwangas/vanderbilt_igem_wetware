        <header>Our Idea</header>
        <p>Long before the advent of modern science, it was recognized that certain plants are
            capable of producing compounds of immense value.</p>
        <img id="vial" class="var_page_img" src="Oils_vial_design.jpg" alt="Oils in a vial" width="297" height="244" >
        <p>From a single class of molecule, the terpenoids, come properties including agents with therapeutic
            qualities against maladies ranging from cancer to infection, antimicrobials, natural pesticides,
            rich flavorants, and fragrant scents.</p>
        <p>However, the utilization of these remarkable compounds has been severely hindered by their rarity
            in nature: many are found in only a small number of species and produced at levels measured in
            parts per million2. Synthetic biology offers an opportunity to resolve this problem, by applying
            metabolic engineering in order to create cellular factories. Our project seeks to use the ideas of
            synthetic biology to develop a commercially viable strategy for the efficient production of a wide
            range of terpenoids.</p>

        <header>Our Approach</header>
        <p>We believe that common brewer's yeast, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is an excellent platform for
            engineering terpenoid biosynthetic pathways.</p>
        <p>The mevalonic acid pathway endogenous to yeast produces the key isoprenoid intermediates that are the
            precursors to virtually all terpenoid biosynthesis<sup>3</sup>.</p>
        <p>Genes encoding plant synthases can then be recombinantly expressed in yeast cells, which then take that
            isoprenoid substrate and convert it through one or more steps
            into the final terpenoid product.</p>
        <p>A specially designed biobrick shuttle vector developed by our team should make the process convenient and
            reliable, by allowing us to first amplify plasmids containing
            our gene of interest in E. coli and permitting the integration of synthase genes directly into the yeast
            genome through homologous recombination.</p>
        <p>A carefully-refined protocol is expected to further improve product yield, by extracting genetic sequences
            directly from plant genomic DNA and mating cells to form diploid transformants.</p>
        <p>Combined, our approach promises to be an effective manufacturing platform for these precious
            (and sweet-smelling) compounds.</p>
